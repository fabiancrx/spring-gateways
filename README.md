See the [description](https://github.com/fabiancrx/spring-gateways/wiki/Description) in the project wiki to understand
the business logic and requirements of the project.

## Useful URL's
- Swagger-UI :
You can visit `http://<BASEURL>/api/swagger-ui/index.html ` to find the OpenApi definition.
Usually is at http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html
- OpenApi Docs: You can visit `http://<BASEURL>/api/v3/api-docs` Usually at http://localhost:8080/api/v3/api-docs
    - the openapi schema can also be downloaded in `yaml` format by appending .yaml at the url. (This is useful for example to the frontend as all the client repositories are code generated from this open-api shcema using `openapi-generator-cli`, thus maintaining in sync the contract between the backend and the frontend)
- Frontend (made with flutter). Can be found at http://localhost:8080/api/
